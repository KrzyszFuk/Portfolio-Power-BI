Market Mind – Power BI Data Analysis Project
Type: Educational / Portfolio Project

Business Problem:
Market Mind is a market research company supporting a retail client that is still learning its customer base and
marketing campaign effectiveness.
The objective was to analyze marketing campaigns, customer segments, and product performance in order to
identify key drivers of sales and campaign success and support future, more targeted marketing decisions.

Key Business Questions
• How are the six recent marketing campaigns
performing?
• Which product categories generate the highest
revenue?
• Who are the key customer segments?
• What factors influence campaign success and purchasing
decisions?

Volume: 2,240 records, 28 columns
Scope: customer demographics, purchasing behaviour,
campaign responses, product categories

Analysis Scope
Campaign performance vs. customer segments and
purchase channels.
Customer profiling based on education, marital status,
income, age, and household composition.
Purchase drivers identified using Key Influencers analysis.

Key Insights & Business Conclusions
Campaign 6 generates the highest number of purchases and total sales revenue and should be treated as a
benchmark for future campaigns.
Wine and meat are the top-performing product categories and should be prioritized in promotional strategies.
Store and web are the most popular purchase channels, indicating strong omni channel behaviour.
The typical customer:
• has graduation-level education
• is married
• has no children or teenagers at home
• average age: 57
Key factors increasing campaign success:
• income ≤ $44K
• 1 child at home
• high website activity (6+ visits last month)
• single or divorced marital status
Recommendation: Focus future campaigns on digitally active, lower-income customer segments using proven product
categories and replicate the structure of Campaign 6.
